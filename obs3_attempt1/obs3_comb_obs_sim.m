%% Separate parameters
p_psychometric = p(1:4); % parameters for the psychometric model
p_gaussianRT = p(5:9); % parameters for the gaussian RT model


%% Run sim for binary predictions
[pred, yhat_pred] = obs3_psychometric_sim(r, infStates, p_psychometric);

%% Run sim for continuous data modality (logRTs)
[logReactionTime, yhat_rt] = obs3_gaussianRT_sim(r, infStates, p_gaussianRT);


%% save values for both response data modalities
y = [pred logReactionTime];
